              <h1>Common Types of Cyber Attacks and How to Protect Against Them</h1>
              <p class="lead">Cyber attacks can cause significant damage to individuals and organizations alike. They come in many different forms and can result in stolen data, financial loss, and reputational damage. Here are some of the most common types of cyber attacks and tips on how to protect yourself:</p>
              <h2>Phishing Attacks</h2>
              <p>Phishing attacks are a type of social engineering attack where cybercriminals try to trick victims into divulging sensitive information such as login credentials or credit card numbers. To protect against phishing attacks:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Don't click on links or download attachments in emails from unknown sources</li>
                <li>Verify the authenticity of emails and websites before entering sensitive information</li>
                <li>Use anti-phishing software and keep your software up-to-date</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Ransomware Attacks</h2>
              <p>Ransomware attacks involve malware that encrypts a victim's data and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key. To protect against ransomware attacks:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Back up your data regularly and store backups offline or in the cloud</li>
                <li>Use anti-malware software and keep it up-to-date</li>
                <li>Avoid opening suspicious emails or downloading attachments from unknown sources</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks</h2>
              <p>DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a website or network with traffic to the point of causing a service disruption. To protect against DDoS attacks:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Use DDoS mitigation services or hardware to filter out malicious traffic</li>
                <li>Monitor network traffic and block suspicious traffic patterns</li>
                <li>Use a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute traffic across multiple servers</li>
              </ul>
              <p>By taking these steps, you can help protect yourself and your organization against the most common types of cyber attacks.</p>
