            <h1>The Top Cybersecurity Threats and How to Stay Protected</h1>
            <p class="lead">
              As our reliance on technology continues to grow, so does the
              threat of cyber attacks. Here are some of the top cybersecurity
              threats and how to stay protected:
            </p>
            <h2>Phishing Attacks</h2>
            <p>
              Phishing attacks are one of the most common types of cyber
              attacks, where attackers try to trick users into divulging
              sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers. To
              stay protected against phishing attacks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages</li>
              <li>
                Verify the authenticity of links and attachments before clicking
                on them
              </li>
              <li>Use two-factor authentication for sensitive accounts</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Ransomware</h2>
            <p>
              Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts your files and
              demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. To prevent and
              mitigate the damage of ransomware attacks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Keep your software and operating system up to date with the
                latest security patches
              </li>
              <li>
                Regularly back up your important files to an external hard drive
                or cloud storage
              </li>
              <li>
                Use antivirus and anti-malware software to detect and remove
                threats
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2>
            <p>
              Man-in-the-middle attacks occur when an attacker intercepts
              communication between two parties and can potentially steal
              sensitive information. To protect against man-in-the-middle
              attacks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use secure protocols such as HTTPS and SSL/TLS</li>
              <li>
                Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive transactions
              </li>
              <li>
                Use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet
                connection
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              By taking proactive steps to protect yourself against these common
              cybersecurity threats, you can reduce your risk of becoming a
              victim of a cyber attack.
